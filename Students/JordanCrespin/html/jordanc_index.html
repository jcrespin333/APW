  <h1>Project Description: I am taking a CodeCademy course to learn Swift (the language used for apps). After finishing the course, I plan on creating an app that shows a doctor's (my dad's) schedule/availibliies and allows patients to make appointments. (If I don't have enough time to complete the app, which I mostly likely won't, I plan on working on finishing the app as part of my Bridge project).</h1>
